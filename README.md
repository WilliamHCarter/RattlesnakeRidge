## Overview

In Rattlesnake Ridge, the player faces off against 4 AI Agents (Powered by the OpenAI API) in order to solve a mystery in a small western town. These AI agents are aware of some facts surrounding the case, and may provide clues to the player, or deceive the player, based on the scenario and their role in the crime that the player is investigating.

2. Install dependencies:

   Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated:

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # For Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # For MacOS and Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
