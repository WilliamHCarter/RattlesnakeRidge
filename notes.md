I wonder if, instead of including a character description in the prompt, we could finetune a number of smaller, cheaper LLMs with captured outputs from `GPT-3.5`.


Current plotline draft:
---

**Opening Scene**:
As the sun sets on the horizon, you ride into the dusty outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge. The villagers are gathered around the town center, murmuring about a heinous crime: a local prospector named Jeb, known for recently striking gold, has been found dead. Word is that his stash of gold is missing too. You decide to step in, and after introducing yourself, you have the option to speak to the main suspects: Whistle, Miss Clara, Marshal Flint, and Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson. 

---

**Night Event Cutscene**:
The moon is high when a piercing scream echoes through the night. Everyone rushes out to find Whistle's Saloon in disarray â€“ a scuffle has occurred. You notice a bloodied poker card on the floor, the ace of spades. This might be a clue, but to what?

---

**Next Morning**:
Sunlight reveals tense faces. The townfolk have formed two groups. On one side, by the water trough, stands Whistle, looking ruffled, and Miss Clara, her comforting hand on his arm. They seem to be arguing with the other group, consisting of Marshal Flint and Billy, who are on the steps of the Marshal's Office. You need to make a choice quickly: which duo will you approach to get their side of the story?

- **Whistle and Miss Clara**: They share their worries about the safety of the town and hint that the Marshal might be too close to the case to see it clearly. They also mention that Billy was seen sneaking around the Saloon the previous night.

- **Marshal Flint and Billy**: Flint sternly talks about the need for law and order and subtly hints that Whistle's gambling den was bound to attract trouble. Billy, defensive, says he did visit the Saloon but only to confront Whistle about a debt. 

After your conversation, a distant gunshot rings out, causing panic. This gives the townsfolk a reason to scatter, heading to their homes or businesses to seek cover.

**Afternoon Investigation**:
The town is quieter now, nerves on edge. You have the chance to speak to one more person in-depth. Each character will drop a crucial hint:

- **Whistle**: Mentions that Jeb had recently won big in a poker game and was flashing his gold around.

- **Miss Clara**: Reveals she had seen Billy and Jeb argue in the past over a shared secret. 

- **Marshal Flint**: Admits to having known Jeb from before Rattlesnake Ridge, hinting at a history.

- **Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson**: Confesses he owed Jeb money, but swears he didn't kill him. He hints that Jeb had other enemies.

---

**Final Confrontation**:
Night has fallen. You gather everyone in the Saloon, where the mood is palpable. Shadows dance on the walls as you lay out your deductions. After presenting your case, in a dramatic crescendo, you make the fateful choice, aiming your gun and pulling the trigger on the character you believe to be the killer.

- **Correct Choice**: The town breathes a sigh of relief as the real killer's guilt is unveiled through a confession or revealing piece of evidence. The ghost of Jeb can rest easy.

- **Wrong Choice**: As your chosen suspect crumples, chaos ensues. The real killer takes advantage of the confusion, locking you up in the Marshal's Office with accusations of murder, while they make their escape, leaving you with the weight of your misjudgment.
