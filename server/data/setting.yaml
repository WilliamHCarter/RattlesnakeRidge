overview: |
  Welcome to the quiet outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge, nestled in a dry canyon away from the main routes. Most buildings are situated along the main dirt road that leads into town. From east to west, there's:

  1. *Whistle's Saloon* - A two-story establishment with swinging doors, run by a man named Whistle. 
  2. *General Store* - Run by Miss Clara, where you can get everything from fresh produce to bullets.
  3. *Town Jail & Marshal's Office* - A small stone structure, guarded by the town's only Marshal, Marshal Flint.
  4. *Abandoned Mine* - Located on the far west, it was once bustling with miners, but now serves as a grim reminder of a cave-in tragedy from a decade ago.
