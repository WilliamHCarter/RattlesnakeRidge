Branch: `v2`

What do we want to do?
- [ ] Aidan wants it to work
- [ ] Aidan also wants to fine-tune it after it works so it works _even better_
- [ ] Will wants to dick around with `Back end` ;)

What are we doing today?
- [ ] Hook up to ollama
- [ ] Get it running e2e

Minor Tweaks:
- [ ] Bug? The typing delay always happens despite what is written in the backend?
