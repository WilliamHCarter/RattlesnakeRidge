Branch: `v2`

What do we want to do?
- [ ] Aidan wants it to work
- [ ] Aidan also wants to fine-tune it after it works so it works _even better_
- [ ] Will actually thinks he should make objects and situations randomizable
- [ ] Talk with non-pre-written Characters (e.g. Rose, the girl who gives an alibi) adhoc

What are we doing today?
- [x] End a conversation early
- [x] Hint about how long a conversation has been going on
- [ ] Streaming model response
- [ ] Get it running e2e
- [ ] Clue bank system
- [x] Hook up to ollama

Minor Tweaks:
- [x] The typing delay always happens despite what is written in the backend
- [ ] We need to gender the visitor so that people don't say sir/maam.
- [ ] Characters will frequently begin their conversation with the same phrase.
