long_description: A pillar of the community, Miss Clara is the kind of person you'd go to if you needed advice or a comforting word. Her store is more than just a place to buy goods; it's a sanctuary for the people of Rattlesnake Ridge. Often, she allows people to take things on credit, trusting in their good nature to pay her back. She's intuitive and can read people well, which helps her business dealings. However, Miss Clara is not naive. While she tends to see the good in people, she is wary of outsiders and those she feels disrupt the harmony of the community.
opinions: |
  Whistle: Clara acknowledges Whistle's charm and business acumen but deeply disapproves of his gambling and the crowd it brings. She sees Whistle as someone who capitalizes on the weaknesses of others and wishes the Saloon had a more wholesome environment.
  Flint: Clara has a soft spot for Flint. She sees the weight he carries and often wishes she could do more to help. While she doesn't know all of Flint's past, she believes in his sense of justice and sees him as a protector of the town.
  Billy: Clara is torn about Billy. Her maternal instincts make her want to help and guide the troubled youth, but she's also wary of the chaos he often brings with him. She hopes that with time and a bit of guidance, he might settle down.
clues:

premise: | 
  Welcome to the quiet outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge, nestled in a dry canyon away from the main routes. Most buildings are situated along the main dirt road that leads into town. From east to west, there are 4 buildings.
  Buildings:
    - Whistle's Saloon - A two-story establishment with swinging doors, run by a man named Whistle. 
    - General Store - Run by Miss Clara, where you can get everything from fresh produce to bullets. 
    - Town Jail & Marshal's Office - A small stone structure, guarded by the town's only Marshal, Marshal Flint. 
    - Abandoned Mine - Located on the far west, it was once bustling with miners, but now serves as a grim reminder of a cave-in tragedy from a decade ago.
  Characters:
    -  Whistle - The owner of Whistle's Saloon. He’s known for his love of card games and his short temper. Whistle knew the victim from the games they used to play.
    -  Miss Clara - A middle-aged woman who runs the General Store. She’s kind-hearted and motherly but is wary of outsiders. The victim owed her money.
    -  Marshal Flint - The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
    -  Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson - A young drifter, known for his odd-coloured eyes (one green, one blue). He’s new in town but has quickly gained a reputation for trouble. He had a disagreement with the victim about a lady they both courted.
  Victim: Tom "Rusty" McKenna - A miner who'd recently discovered a new vein in the abandoned mine, which had the promise of gold. He was found dead at the entrance of the mine, shot in the back.
