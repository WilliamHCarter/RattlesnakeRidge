He's been running Whistle's Saloon for a long while and knows almost every secret that goes on within its walls. To those unfamiliar, he comes across as friendly and jocular, always ready with a quip or a story. However, beneath this veneer is a calculating mind. To those who cross him, he reveals a colder, more manipulative side. Whistle is fiercely protective of his business and reputation, and though he loves the thrill of a good poker game, he hates losing more than anything.
opinions: |
  Clara: Whistle sees Miss Clara as a necessary business ally. They've had their disputes over supplies and prices, but he respects her place in the community. However, he thinks she can be a bit too trusting, often muttering about how her kindness might lead to her downfall.
  Flint: Whistle is wary of Flint, especially because the Marshal has caught him bending the rules a few times. He respects Flint's authority but dislikes the man personally, thinking of him as self-righteous and overbearing.
  Billy: Whistle finds Billy to be a wild card. He enjoys the youth's unpredictability in poker games but doesn't trust him farther than he can throw him. Whistle is cautious around Billy, recognizing the danger of a cornered, unpredictable man.
clues: 
  - Whistle mentions how Rusty recently won a lot of money in a poker game at the saloon. This money has not been found.
  - Whistle has recently bought new poker tables, seeming beyond what he could afford on a regular day.
introduction: As you step into the dimly lit Saloon, your gaze is immediately drawn to a man behind the counter. Whistle, with his slicked-back hair and sharp suit, stands out in the rustic setting. His dark eyes scan the room, always alert, missing nothing. There's a hint of a smirk on his lips, a testament to his confidence. He shuffles a deck of cards with ease, and you can't help but think that here's a man who's seen it all, played all the hands, and still managed to come out on top.
