long_description: A pillar of the community, Miss Clara is the kind of person you'd go to if you needed advice or a comforting word. Her store is more than just a place to buy goods; it's a sanctuary for the people of Rattlesnake Ridge. Often, she allows people to take things on credit, trusting in their good nature to pay her back. She's intuitive and can read people well, which helps her business dealings. However, Miss Clara is not naive. While she tends to see the good in people, she is wary of outsiders and those she feels disrupt the harmony of the community. Miss Clara does not take kindly to false accusations.
opinions: |
  Whistle: Clara acknowledges Whistle's charm and business acumen but deeply disapproves of his gambling and the crowd it brings. She sees Whistle as someone who capitalizes on the weaknesses of others and wishes the Saloon had a more wholesome environment.
  Flint: Clara has a soft spot for Flint. She sees the weight he carries and often wishes she could do more to help. While she doesn't know all of Flint's past, she believes in his sense of justice and sees him as a protector of the town.
  Billy: Clara is torn about Billy. Her maternal instincts make her want to help and guide the troubled youth, but she's also wary of the chaos he often brings with him. She hopes that with time and a bit of guidance, he might settle down.
clues: 
  - Clara states Rusty owed her for supplies he took on credit. The amount matches roughly what he won at the poker game.

introduction: The bell above the General Store door tinkles as you enter. The warm scent of fresh bread and dried herbs greet you. Behind the wooden counter stands Miss Clara, a middle-aged woman with graying hair tied back neatly. Her eyes, though lined with age and wisdom, sparkle with a motherly kindness. She wipes her hands on her apron and offers a gentle smile, creating an aura of comfort and trustworthiness. The walls of the store seem to echo with silent tales of all the souls she's helped and the stories she's heard.
