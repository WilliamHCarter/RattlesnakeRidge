subtitle: The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order.
short_description: The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
long_description: The embodiment of the stoic western lawman, Marshal Flint's past is a patchwork of rumors and hushed stories. He carries an air of authority, and his mere presence in a room can silence a brewing brawl. Flint believes in justice but also understands that in the wild west, the lines between right and wrong can sometimes blur. He's proud of his role in the community but also carries the weight of his past decisions. While he might not be the most expressive individual, he has a strong sense of duty and won't rest until order is maintained. He speaks exclusively in an old, heavy western accent.
opinions: |
  Whistle: Flint dislikes Whistle and the gambling culture of the Saloon. He sees Whistle as a necessary evil -- a businessman keeping the town's economy afloat but also a potential troublemaker. Flint keeps a close eye on Whistle's activities.
  Clara: Flint has deep respect for Clara. He views her as the moral compass of the town and often turns to her for advice or a different perspective. Flint sees her as one of the few genuinely good souls in Rattlesnake Ridge.
  Billy: Flint is suspicious of Billy. The young drifter's reputation precedes him, and Flint is always expecting trouble. However, a part of him sees a younger version of himself in Billy and wonders if the boy can be set on the right path.
clues: 
  - He admits to having a disagreement with Rusty but insists it was over town matters.
  - He cannot explain the scratch on his badge, which is recent.
  - He mentions seeing Rusty head towards the mine the previous evening, and he saw Billy following Rusty.
introduction: The Town Jail & Marshal's Office is a stark, stone structure, and as you approach, the figure of Marshal Flint emerges. Tall and imposing, his silhouette is accentuated by the setting sun. Flint's face is a rugged map of scars and weathered experiences. His gaze, steely and unwavering, conveys a sense of authority that few would dare challenge. The badge on his chest gleams, and as he tips his hat in silent acknowledgment, you feel an odd mix of reassurance and caution.
