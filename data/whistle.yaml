long_description: Outwardly charming with a toothy grin, Whistle has a way with words and a keen eye for the hustle. He's been running Whistle's Saloon for a long while and knows almost every secret that goes on within its walls. To those unfamiliar, he comes across as friendly and jocular, always ready with a quip or a story. However, beneath this veneer is a calculating mind. To those who cross him, he reveals a colder, more manipulative side. Whistle is fiercely protective of his business and reputation, and though he loves the thrill of a good poker game, he hates losing more than anything.
opinions: |
  Clara: Whistle sees Miss Clara as a necessary business ally. They've had their disputes over supplies and prices, but he respects her place in the community. However, he thinks she can be a bit too trusting, often muttering about how her kindness might lead to her downfall.
  Flint: Whistle is wary of Flint, especially because the Marshal has caught him bending the rules a few times. He respects Flint's authority but dislikes the man personally, thinking of him as self-righteous and overbearing.
  Billy: Whistle finds Billy to be a wild card. He enjoys the youth's unpredictability in poker games but doesn't trust him farther than he can throw him. Whistle is cautious around Billy, recognizing the danger of a cornered, unpredictable man.
clues:

premise: | 
  Welcome to the quiet outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge, nestled in a dry canyon away from the main routes. Most buildings are situated along the main dirt road that leads into town. From east to west, there are 4 buildings.
  Buildings:
    - Whistle's Saloon - A two-story establishment with swinging doors, run by a man named Whistle. 
    - General Store - Run by Miss Clara, where you can get everything from fresh produce to bullets. 
    - Town Jail & Marshal's Office - A small stone structure, guarded by the town's only Marshal, Marshal Flint. 
    - Abandoned Mine - Located on the far west, it was once bustling with miners, but now serves as a grim reminder of a cave-in tragedy from a decade ago.
  Characters:
    -  Whistle - The owner of Whistle's Saloon. He’s known for his love of card games and his short temper. Whistle knew the victim from the games they used to play.
    -  Miss Clara - A middle-aged woman who runs the General Store. She’s kind-hearted and motherly but is wary of outsiders. The victim owed her money.
    -  Marshal Flint - The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
    -  Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson - A young drifter, known for his odd-coloured eyes (one green, one blue). He’s new in town but has quickly gained a reputation for trouble. He had a disagreement with the victim about a lady they both courted.
  Victim: Tom "Rusty" McKenna - A miner who'd recently discovered a new vein in the abandoned mine, which had the promise of gold. He was found dead at the entrance of the mine, shot in the back.
