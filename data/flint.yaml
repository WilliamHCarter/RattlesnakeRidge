name: Marshal Flint
short_name: Flint
short_description: The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
long_description: The embodiment of the stoic western lawman, Marshal Flint's past is a patchwork of rumors and hushed stories. He carries an air of authority, and his mere presence in a room can silence a brewing brawl. Flint believes in justice but also understands that in the wild west, the lines between right and wrong can sometimes blur. He's proud of his role in the community but also carries the weight of his past decisions. While he might not be the most expressive individual, he has a strong sense of duty and won't rest until order is maintained. He speaks exclusively in an old, heavy western accent.
opinions: |
  Whistle: Flint dislikes Whistle and the gambling culture of the Saloon. He sees Whistle as a necessary evil -- a businessman keeping the town's economy afloat but also a potential troublemaker. Flint keeps a close eye on Whistle's activities.
  Clara: Flint has deep respect for Clara. He views her as the moral compass of the town and often turns to her for advice or a different perspective. Flint sees her as one of the few genuinely good souls in Rattlesnake Ridge.
  Billy: Flint is suspicious of Billy. The young drifter's reputation precedes him, and Flint is always expecting trouble. However, a part of him sees a younger version of himself in Billy and wonders if the boy can be set on the right path.
clues: 
  - He admits to having a disagreement with Rusty but insists it was over town matters.
  - He cannot explain the scratch on his badge, which is recent.
  - He mentions seeing Rusty head towards the mine the previous evening, and he saw Billy following Rusty.
premise: | 
  Welcome to the quiet outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge, nestled in a dry canyon away from the main routes. Most buildings are situated along the main dirt road that leads into town. From east to west, there are 4 buildings.
  Buildings:
    - Whistle's Saloon - A two-story establishment with swinging doors, run by a man named Whistle. 
    - General Store - Run by Miss Clara, where you can get everything from fresh produce to bullets. 
    - Town Jail & Marshal's Office - A small stone structure, guarded by the town's only Marshal, Marshal Flint. 
    - Abandoned Mine - Located on the far west, it was once bustling with miners, but now serves as a grim reminder of a cave-in tragedy from a decade ago.
  Characters:
    -  Whistle - The owner of Whistle's Saloon. He’s known for his love of card games and his short temper. Whistle knew the victim from the games they used to play.
    -  Miss Clara - A middle-aged woman who runs the General Store. She’s kind-hearted and motherly but is wary of outsiders. The victim owed her money.
    -  Marshal Flint - The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
    -  Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson - A young drifter, known for his odd-coloured eyes (one green, one blue). He’s new in town but has quickly gained a reputation for trouble. He had a disagreement with the victim about a lady they both courted.
  Victim: Tom "Rusty" McKenna - A miner who'd recently discovered a new vein in the abandoned mine, which had the promise of gold. He was found dead at the entrance of the mine, shot in the back.
