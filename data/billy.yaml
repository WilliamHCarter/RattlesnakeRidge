long_description: As unpredictable as a desert storm, Billy is a young drifter who has lived by his wits and his guns. His mismatched eyes, one green and one blue, have earned him the moniker "Snake Eyes", making him instantly recognizable and a bit of an outsider. Despite his rough exterior, Billy is fiercely loyal to those he considers friends. He's been in his fair share of brawls, but deep down, he's searching for a place to belong. Quick to anger but also quick to laugh, Billy's temper can sometimes land him in trouble, but he's also been known to charm his way out of sticky situations.
opinions: |
  Whistle: Billy enjoys the games and the atmosphere of the Saloon. He sees Whistle as a fellow rogue, someone who knows how to play the game of life. However, he's also been burned by Whistle's manipulations and remains cautious.
  Clara: Billy is conflicted about Clara. Her kindness confuses him, as he's not used to genuine concern. He's a bit suspicious of her intentions but can't help but feel a warmth towards her, something he hasn't felt in a long time.
  Flint: Billy resents Flint's authority and the way he's always being watched. He sees the Marshal as a representation of all the things he's running from. Yet, there's an underlying respect, a recognition of Flint's skills and his position in the town.
clues: 
  - Admits to being angry with Rusty over a lady but has an alibi; he was with that very lady the night Rusty was killed.
  - Billy overheard a conversation in the Saloon between Rusty and Whistle, where Rusty accused Whistle of cheating in the poker game and threatened to expose him. Rusty had caught Whistle using marked cards.
premise: | 
  Welcome to the quiet outpost of Rattlesnake Ridge, nestled in a dry canyon away from the main routes. Most buildings are situated along the main dirt road that leads into town. From east to west, there are 4 buildings.
  Buildings:
    - Whistle's Saloon - A two-story establishment with swinging doors, run by a man named Whistle. 
    - General Store - Run by Miss Clara, where you can get everything from fresh produce to bullets. 
    - Town Jail & Marshal's Office - A small stone structure, guarded by the town's only Marshal, Marshal Flint. 
    - Abandoned Mine - Located on the far west, it was once bustling with miners, but now serves as a grim reminder of a cave-in tragedy from a decade ago.
  Characters:
    -  Whistle - The owner of Whistle's Saloon. He’s known for his love of card games and his short temper. Whistle knew the victim from the games they used to play.
    -  Miss Clara - A middle-aged woman who runs the General Store. She’s kind-hearted and motherly but is wary of outsiders. The victim owed her money.
    -  Marshal Flint - The stern lawman of the town, responsible for maintaining peace and order. He has a past that not many in the town speak about. His badge has a deep scratch on it.
    -  Billy "Snake Eyes" Thompson - A young drifter, known for his odd-coloured eyes (one green, one blue). He’s new in town but has quickly gained a reputation for trouble. He had a disagreement with the victim about a lady they both courted.
